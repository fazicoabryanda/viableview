## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following (or add more specific versions if known):
    ```txt
    streamlit
    opencv-python-headless
    ultralytics
    Pillow
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-image
    scikit-learn
    streamlit-option-menu
    # Add any other specific versions if necessary
    ```
    Then install:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Ensure Model Files are Present:**
    Place the YOLO model files in the root directory of the project (or update paths in the script if they are located elsewhere):
    * `counting_model2.pt`
    * `viability_model2.pt`
    * `purity_model.pt`

5.  **Ensure Asset Files are Present:**
    Place the following asset files in the root directory (or update paths if necessary):
    * `icon.ico` (for page icon)
    * `logo.png` (for Home page)
    * `Aset1.png` (for Home page)
    * `kirito.jpg` (Fazico's profile picture on Contact page)
    * `Mira-Widiastuti-2.png` (Mira's profile picture on Contact page)

6.  **Create `pages` Directory for "About" page:**
    * Create a directory named `pages` in the root of your project.
    * Inside the `pages` directory, create an `About.py` file (the content for this page is not in the provided script, but the navigation points to it). Example:
        ```python
        # pages/About.py
        import streamlit as st

        st.set_page_config(layout="wide", page_title="About - Seed Analysis Suite")

        st.title("About the Seed Analysis Suite")
        st.write("""
        This application is designed to provide advanced analysis of seeds...
        (Add more details about the project, its purpose, acknowledgments, etc.)
        """)
        ```

7.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_main_script_name.py
    ```
    (Replace `your_main_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., `app.py`).
